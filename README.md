# WebScreensaver
An attempt to build a screensaver, that shows a webpage.

Well... here we are. Me, a newbie in windows programming and C#, trying to make a screensaver, that simply displays a webpage.
So far, the webpage is hard coded, but it's shown full screen. In the screensaver later, a key has to be pressed to quit, mouse movement does not work yet.

You also have to build the project, then rename the file extension to .scr, and put the file into C:\Windows\SysWOW64 to make it selectable in the screensaver menu.

## Roadmap
- exiting the screensaver with mouse movement or click or key presses
- make the screensaver configurable, to enter at least the shown webpage
- maybe expand to show multiple pages / cycle through them / cool stuff
